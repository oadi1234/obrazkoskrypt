Simple script that reads links out of a word file and screenshots the websites inside.
Made for a friend.
use "comments.py". "Image extractor.py" is a work in progress script to allow reading from google docs, and "comments - copy.py" is an older version saved from before I bothered to move it into version control.

compile "comments.py" to exe with [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/operating-mode.html) if needed.
